BINARY TREES
We have seen that we can represent any tree as a binary tree. In fact, binary trees are an
important type of tree structure that occurs very often. The chief characteristic of a bainary tree is not exceed two.
For binary tree is the stipulation that the deree of any given node rbtree and the right subtree, while forbinary trees, we also distinguish between the left sutrees the order ofithe subtrees is irrelevant. In addition, a binary tree may have zero
nodes. Thus, a binary tree is really a different object than a tree.
